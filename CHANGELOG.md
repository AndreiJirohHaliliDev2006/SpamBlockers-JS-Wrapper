# Changelog

When an new version was released, we'll include any changes here and in README.

## Latest version - v0.3.0

Install the latest version with `npm i @spamblockers/api@latest`.

> :warning: **THIS UPDATE WILL MAKE THIS WRAPPER
INCOMPATIBLE WITH SPAMWATCH API.** We're working on some ways to make stuff works with SpamWatch API and its wrappers soon. PRs are welcome!

* Pulled 3 commits from the upstream repository's `v0.3.1` codebase. That's means we need to fix some conflicts on `client.js`.
* Updated the `package-lock.json` to be the same as `package.json` (name and version).
* New error types, so some customizations also happen there.

## [v0.2.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spamblockers/api/v/0.2.0)

Install the second beta with `npm i @spamblockers/api@0.2.0`.

* Updated the README to include changelog, available functions and credits, among other things.
* Renamed some functions for clarifications.

## [v0.1.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spamblockers/api/v/0.1.0)

Install the first beta version with `npm i @spamblockers/api@0.1.0`.

* Initial version of the package, as part of the development of [SpmBlockers API Server](https://gitlab.com/SpamBlockers/API-Server).
* Forked from [`github:SpamWatch/spamwatch-js`](https://github.com/SpamWatch-spamwatch-js)
